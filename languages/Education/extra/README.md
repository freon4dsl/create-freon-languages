# Howto Install Lessons

This folder contains subfolders, one for each lesson in the Freon tutorial.

To install a lesson:

- Remove all files in the `defs` folder (non-recursive!)
- Copy the files from the lesson folder ypou want to the `defs` folder.
- Run `npm run build`.

And you can run the editor based on the lesson.
